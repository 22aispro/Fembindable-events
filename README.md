# ðŸ”— fembindables

**fembindables** is a fast and minimal signal (event) system for Lua-based environments like Roblox. It provides simple APIs for creating, connecting, firing, and disconnecting events efficiently.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### âž• Create a New Signal

```lua
-- Create a new signal instance named "OnSomethingHappened"
-- This will act like a custom event that you can fire and listen to
local MySignal = fembindables.new("OnSomethingHappened")

-- Connect the first listener (callback function) to the signal
-- This function will be called whenever MySignal:Fire(...) is called
local connection1 = MySignal:Connect(function(message)
	print("Listener 1 received:", message)
end)

-- Connect a second listener to the same signal
-- Multiple functions can listen to the same signal independently
local connection2 = MySignal:Connect(function(message)
	print("Listener 2 received:", message)
end)

-- Fire the signal with a message argument
-- Both listeners will receive this message and print it
MySignal:Fire("Event Fired!")

-- Output:
-- Listener 1 received: Event Fired!
-- Listener 2 received: Event Fired!

-- Disconnect the first listener
-- It will no longer respond to future Fire() calls
connection1:Disconnect()

-- Fire the signal again with a new message
-- Only Listener 2 will respond now
MySignal:Fire("Fired again!")

-- Output:
-- Listener 2 received: Fired again!

-- Disconnect all remaining listeners (in this case, just Listener 2)
-- This clears all callbacks attached to the signal
MySignal:DisconnectAll()

-- Fire the signal once more
-- No listeners are connected, so nothing happens
MySignal:Fire("This won't be seen")

-- Output: (no output)
```
